# Dashboard view

## Goal

Add a second top-level page, `/dashboards`, alongside the existing query
workflow. An AI agent (e.g. Claude Code) authors a dashboard — an HTML layout
plus a set of named SQL queries — and pushes it into a live, armed QueryView
browser session via a new MCP tool. The dashboard is also persisted so it can
be reopened later by name.

The **React frontend** runs the dashboard's queries (it is the trusted code with
access to the session) against a named connection and feeds the results into the
agent-authored HTML, which renders inside an isolated iframe. The agent never
receives query results back — the browser is the consumer, exactly as in the
existing MCP push-to-UI layer.

This builds directly on the existing `remote.py` push hub, the SSE channel, and
the `predefined_queries` persistence pattern.

## Decisions

Settled during brainstorming:

1. **Two top-level pages, client-side routed** (`react-router-dom`):
   `/queries` (today's workflow) and `/dashboards` (new). `App` becomes a thin
   shell; today's `App` body is renamed `QueryView`.
2. **Lifecycle = persist + reopen.** `upsert_dashboard` saves
   `{name, connection, html, queries}` to SQLite (upsert by `name`) **and**
   pushes it live to the armed session. `/dashboards` lists saved dashboards;
   `/dashboards/:name` reopens one after a reload.
3. **HTML rendering = sandboxed iframe + CDN.** Agent-authored HTML renders in
   `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts" srcdoc=…>` (no `allow-same-origin`), isolated
   from the app's cookies/DOM. Results are injected as a `window.queries` JS
   global. External chart libraries from a CDN are allowed (no restrictive CSP).
4. **Result shape = `{header, rows}`.** `/api/runqueries` returns
   `{query_name: {"header": ["col", …], "rows": [[v, …], …]}}`; a failed query
   yields `{query_name: {"error": "…"}}` so one bad query does not sink the
   dashboard.
5. **`/runqueries` takes an explicit connection name**, not the session's active
   connection — a dashboard is self-contained and portable. The dashboard stores
   its `connection`; `upsert_dashboard` takes it as a required parameter.
6. **`session_id` vs `connection` are distinct**: `session_id` is the live
   browser to push the preview to; `connection` is the data source the queries
   run against.

## Architecture & data flow

                                                                                                                          ▼
                                                                                  DashboardView (React, trusted origin)
                                                                                    │ POST /api/runqueries {connection, queries}
                                                                                    ▼
                                                              run_queries_for_connection → ClickHouse → {name:{header,rows}}
                                                                                    │ inject as window.queries
                                                                                    ▼
                                                              <iframe sandbox="allow-scripts" srcdoc=html> renders
```

The MCP tool and the REST `POST /api/dashboards` are thin wrappers over one
shared upsert-and-push function, mirroring how `push_query` and
`POST /api/remote/push` both wrap `remote.push`. The REST mirror lets the e2e
suite drive the flow with plain `httpx`.

## Backend

### New module `backend/queryview/dashboards.py`

Mirrors `queries.py`; reuses the SQLite engine owned by `connect.py`.

```python
class Dashboard(SQLModel, table=True):
    __tablename__ = "dashboards"
    id: int | None = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    name: str = Field(unique=True, index=True)
    connection: str                  # connection name the queries run against
    html: str                        # agent-authored HTML document
    queries: str                     # JSON text: {query_name: SQL}
    updated_at: int                  # unix ms
```

Functions:
- `upsert_dashboard(name, connection, html, queries: dict[str, str]) -> None`
  — upsert by `name`; `queries` serialized to JSON text.
- `get_dashboard(name) -> dict | None` — `{name, connection, html, queries}`
  with `queries` parsed back to a dict; `None` if absent.
- `list_dashboards() -> list[dict]` — `[{name, connection, updated_at}, …]`
  ordered by `name` (no `html`/`queries` payload in the list).

### New connection-scoped query runner (`backend/queryview/connect.py`)

`run_queries_for_connection(name, queries: dict[str, str]) -> dict` — decoupled
from session/cookie state:
- Looks up the saved connection by name (`_connection_by_name`); if absent,
  returns `{"ok": False, "message": 'no connection named "<name>"'}`.
- Uses the connection's **stored database**; if none is set, every query result
  is an error advising that the connection has no selected database (queries may
  still fully-qualify `db.table` — but no default database is supplied).
- Runs each query through the existing `ch_query` path (wrapped in a paginated
  subselect with a dashboard result cap; no `order_by`), parses the
  `TabSeparatedWithNames` output into `{header, rows}`.
- Returns `{"ok": True, "results": {name: {header, rows} | {error}}}`. A failing
  query is captured as `{name: {"error": message}}`; the call as a whole still
  succeeds.

Result cap: a module constant (e.g. `DASHBOARD_ROW_CAP = 1000`) applied as the
`LIMIT` of the paginating subselect, matching the existing 1000-row ceiling on
`/api/clickhouse/query`.

### Endpoints (`backend/queryview/main.py`)

Declared **before** the SPA catch-all so they are not shadowed.

- `POST /api/runqueries` — body `{connection: str, queries: {name: SQL}}`.
  Validates `connection` is a non-empty string and `queries` is a non-empty
  mapping of string→string (others ignored). Calls
  `run_queries_for_connection`. Returns `{ok: true, results}` or
  `{ok: false, message}` (400 on missing/empty `connection` or `queries`).
- `POST /api/dashboards` — REST mirror of the MCP tool. Body
  `{name, connection, html, queries, session_id?}`. Validates `name`,
  `connection`, `html` non-empty and `queries` a string→string mapping. Calls
  the shared `_upsert_and_push` helper (persist via `dashboards.py`, then, if
  `session_id` given, best-effort `remote.push`). Returns
  `{ok, persisted, pushed, message}`. 400 on missing required fields.
- `GET /api/dashboards` — `{dashboards: list_dashboards()}`.
- `GET /api/dashboards/{name}` — `get_dashboard(name)` or 404
  `{error: "not found"}`.

`_upsert_and_push(name, connection, html, queries, session_id)` — the shared
helper both the MCP tool and the REST endpoint call:
1. `dashboards.upsert_dashboard(...)` (always; `persisted = True`).
2. If `session_id`: `ok, msg = remote.push(session_id, {type:"dashboard",
   name, connection, html, queries})`; `pushed = ok`.
3. Return `(persisted, pushed, message)`.

### SSE event naming (`backend/queryview/main.py`)

Generalize `_event_stream`: emit the SSE event named by the payload's `type`
field (`query` or `dashboard`) instead of hardcoding `"query"`:

```python
yield _sse(msg.get("type", "query"), msg)
```

The browser listens for both `query` and `dashboard` events. Existing
`push_query` payloads carry `type: "query"`, so behavior is unchanged.

### MCP tool (`backend/queryview/mcp_server.py`)

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def upsert_dashboard(session_id: str, name: str, connection: str,
                           html: str, queries: dict[str, str]) -> dict:
    """Create or update a dashboard and push it to a live QueryView session.

    Persists the dashboard (HTML + named SQL) by name, then pushes it to the
    browser identified by session_id (the id from the QueryView agent popover),
    which navigates to it and renders it. The dashboard's queries run against
    the named connection. Returns {ok, persisted, pushed, message}.
    """
    persisted, pushed, message = await _upsert_and_push(
        name, connection, html, queries, session_id)
    return {"ok": persisted, "persisted": persisted, "pushed": pushed,
            "message": message}
```

`_upsert_and_push` lives where both `main.py` and `mcp_server.py` can import it
without a cycle — either in `dashboards.py` (pulling in `remote`) or a small
shared spot. Chosen home: `dashboards.py` already owns persistence; it imports
`remote` (a leaf module) to do the push, keeping `main.py`/`mcp_server.py` thin.

### Dependency

`mcp` already present. No new backend dependency.

## Frontend

### New dependency

`react-router-dom` (v7) added to `frontend/package.json`.

### `App.tsx` — shell

`App` becomes the shell:
- Wraps everything in `<BrowserRouter>`.
- Owns **connection state** (fetched once via `/api/session`; `?connection=`
  handling stays here) and the **persistent connection pill + agent popover**
  (moved out of the old `App` body) so they show on every page.
- Owns the **armed / SSE remote-control** state (`armed`, `remoteId`,
  `agentOpen`). The SSE listener handles both events:
  - `query` event → store payload, navigate to `/queries`.
  - `dashboard` event → store payload, navigate to `/dashboards/:name`.
- A small **nav** (links: Queries / Dashboards).
- Routes:
  | Path | Element |
  |------|---------|
  | `/queries` | `<QueryView … pushed={queryPush} />` |
  | `/dashboards` | `<Dashboards />` (index list) |
  | `/dashboards/:name` | `<DashboardView pushed={dashboardPush} />` |
  | `/` | `<Navigate to="/queries" replace />` |

Navigation on push uses `useNavigate`. A pushed dashboard payload is passed to
`DashboardView` so a freshly-pushed dashboard renders without a refetch; opening
`/dashboards/:name` directly (or after reload) fetches it via the API.

### `QueryView.tsx` — renamed from today's `App` body

The existing prompt/query workflow, minus the connection pill + agent popover
(now in the shell). It keeps the prompt, command parsing, `DatabasePicker`,
`ClickHouseForm`, and `QueryPanel`, and still consumes `pushed` query payloads.
The `dashboard <name>` command navigates to `/dashboards/:name`.

### `Dashboards.tsx` — index page (`/dashboards`)

Fetches `GET /api/dashboards` and lists saved dashboards (name, connection,
updated time) as links to `/dashboards/:name`. Empty state when none exist.
`data-testid="dashboards-index"`.

### `DashboardView.tsx` — single dashboard (`/dashboards/:name`)

Props: optional `pushed` payload (`{name, connection, html, queries}`).
- Resolve the dashboard: use `pushed` if its `name` matches the route param,
  otherwise `GET /api/dashboards/{name}`.
- On the resolved dashboard: `POST /api/runqueries` with
  `{connection, queries}`; store `results`.
- Build the iframe `srcdoc`: a `<script>window.queries = <safe-json></script>`
  prologue followed by the dashboard's `html`. The JSON is produced with
  `JSON.stringify` and `<` escaped (`<`) so an embedded `</script>` cannot
  break out.
- Render `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts" srcdoc={srcdoc}
  data-testid="dashboard-frame" />` at full width. Loading and error states
  (missing dashboard, connection error). `data-testid="dashboard-view"`.

`window.queries` is the documented contract for dashboard authors:
`{query_name: {header: string[], rows: unknown[][]}}` (or `{error}` per query).

## Result / payload shapes

- Push payload (SSE `dashboard` event):
  `{type:"dashboard", name, connection, html, queries:{name:SQL}}`.
- `/api/runqueries` response:
  `{ok:true, results:{name:{header:[…], rows:[[…]]} | {error:"…"}}}`.

## Routing & static serving

`main.py`'s `SERVE_STATIC` SPA fallback already returns `index.html` for any
unknown path, so `/queries` and `/dashboards/*` deep-links work in production;
Vite's dev server provides the same fallback. No backend routing change needed
beyond the new `/api/*` endpoints.

## Edge cases

- **Push to unknown/disarmed session_id** — `remote.push` returns
  `(False, "unknown or inactive session")`; the tool reports `pushed:false`
  while `persisted:true`. The dashboard is still saved and openable by name.
- **Unknown connection in `/runqueries`** — top-level
  `{ok:false, message:'no connection named "<name>"'}`.
- **Connection has no selected database** — each query result is an `{error}`
  advising to select a database (or fully-qualify table names); the dashboard
  still renders its layout with per-panel errors.
- **One failing query among many** — captured as `{name:{error}}`; other panels
  render normally.
- **`</script>` / `<` in result data** — escaped in the injected JSON so it
  cannot break out of the prologue script.
- **Iframe isolation** — `sandbox="allow-scripts"` without `allow-same-origin`
  gives the agent HTML an opaque origin: it can run JS and load CDN assets but
  cannot read the app's cookies, `localStorage`, or reach `/api/*` with
  credentials. All data reaches it only via the injected `window.queries`.
- **Reopen after reload** — `/dashboards/:name` with no `pushed` payload fetches
  from the store and re-runs queries.
- **Backend restart** — in-memory hub drops as today; persisted dashboards
  survive (SQLite). A stale `session_id` push returns not-delivered.

## Security / scope

Matches the app's posture: no auth beyond the opt-in arming toggle for live
push; persisted dashboards are global (shared SQLite), keyed by name, like
`predefined_queries`. Agent HTML is untrusted and confined to a no-same-origin
sandboxed iframe; it receives only query results, never connection secrets or
the session cookie.

## Testing

- **Backend unit (`backend/tests/`)**
  - `dashboards.py`: upsert creates then updates by name; `get_dashboard`
    round-trips the queries dict; `list_dashboards` ordering and omitted payload.
  - `run_queries_for_connection`: unknown connection → top-level error; a good
    query → `{header, rows}`; a bad query → `{error}` while siblings succeed
    (against CI's real ClickHouse, like the existing query tests).
  - `/api/runqueries` route: 400 on missing `connection`/`queries`; success
    shape.
  - `/api/dashboards` route: upsert persists and (with an armed `session_id`)
    pushes; `GET` list and by-name.
- **e2e (Playwright + httpx, CI's real ClickHouse)**
  - connect → select a database → arm remote control → read the session id →
    `httpx POST /api/dashboards` with `{session_id, name, connection, html, queries}`
    where `html` reads `window.queries` and writes a value into the DOM →
    assert the browser navigated to `/dashboards/:name` and the iframe renders
    the expected value → reload / navigate directly to `/dashboards/:name` and
    assert it re-renders from the store → check `/dashboards` index lists it.
- **MCP** — light check that the tool is registered / `/mcp` still responds;
  the REST mirror exercises the same `_upsert_and_push` path.

## Docs

- New `docs/dashboard.md` — the dashboard page, the `upsert_dashboard` tool, the
  `window.queries` contract for HTML authors, `/api/runqueries`, the
  connection-name model, and the end-to-end flow.
- `docs/api.md` — rows for `POST /api/runqueries`, `POST /api/dashboards`,
  `GET /api/dashboards`, `GET /api/dashboards/{name}`; note the `upsert_dashboard`
  MCP tool and the `dashboard` SSE event.
- `docs/queryview.md` — note the two pages / nav and the `dashboard <name>`
  command; cross-link `dashboard.md`.

## Out of scope

- Returning query results to the agent (browser is the consumer).
- Per-connection-type dashboard keying (dashboards are global by name).
- Dashboard deletion / rename UI.
- Multi-worker hub sharing and any auth beyond the opt-in arming toggle.
- Charting on the app side — charts are the agent HTML's concern (via CDN).
