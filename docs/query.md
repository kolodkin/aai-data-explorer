# Querying

Typing `query` (after a database is selected) opens the **query panel**: run SQL
against the session's selected database, page through results, save/load reusable
queries, and export the current page as CSV. Before a database is selected,
`query` shows the hint `Select a database first.`

## Panel

In query mode the command **prompt** moves onto the panel's top row, next to the
predefined-query controls, to save vertical space.

- **SQL textarea** — the query to run. **Min / S / M / L / XL** change its height;
  **Min** collapses it to maximize room for results.
- **Execute** — runs the query at the current offset.
- **Fields** — introspects the query's output columns (see
  [Fields, selection & ordering](#fields-selection--ordering)).
- **Limit / Offset** — page size and starting row (defaults `100` / `0`).
- **Previous / Next** — step the offset by ±limit and re-run. Previous is
  disabled at offset `0`. There is no total-row count, so Next can page past the
  last row into an empty result.
- **Download CSV** — downloads the **current page** as `query.csv`, always with
  **all** columns (the field selection below is view-only).
- **Results table** — the rows for the current page, in a scrollable table.

## Fields, selection & ordering

**Fields** describes the current query's output columns (names and ClickHouse
types) without scanning data (ClickHouse `DESCRIBE (<query>)`), and populates two
pickers from that list:

- **Select fields** — a toggle per column for what the results table shows.
  **Client-side and immediate**: toggling shows/hides the column with no re-query,
  and **Download CSV** ignores it (CSV always exports every column). **Select all**
  / **Clear all** flip every toggle. New columns from a query edited since the last
  **Fields** call always show, so a stale list can't blank the table.
- **Order by** — pick one or more columns, each **ASC** (default) or **DESC**.
  **Server-side**, so it takes effect only on a re-run: **Execute** / **Previous** /
  **Next**, **Download CSV**, or the order-by section's **Run** button (re-runs the
  whole query like Execute, applying the current limit/offset). Column names are
  backtick-quoted and directions whitelisted, so the picker can't inject SQL.

Editing the SQL doesn't auto-refresh the pickers — click **Fields** again to
re-describe.

## Pagination

The backend paginates by wrapping the query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
<your query>
) LIMIT <limit> OFFSET <offset>
```

So pages are stable only if the query defines its own order — include an
`ORDER BY` for predictable `Previous`/`Next` boundaries.

## Predefined queries

Predefined queries are reusable SQL **shared globally** (not per session), keyed
by **connection type** (e.g. `clickhouse`), stored in the `predefined_queries`
SQLite table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE predefined_queries (
  id         INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  query_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  type       TEXT NOT NULL,   -- connection type (clickhouse, …)
  query      TEXT NOT NULL,
  cell_view  TEXT,            -- raw YAML; per-column render config + params (see below)
  UNIQUE (type, query_name)
);
```

- The **selector** lists saved queries for the active connection's type; choosing
  one loads its SQL into the textarea and makes it the active name. Its **+ New
  name…** item prompts for a fresh name (no separate name field).
- **Save** stores the textarea's SQL (and the `cell_view` YAML) under the
  **currently selected name** and refreshes the selector. Saving an existing name
  **upserts** (overwrites) it.

Renaming and deleting predefined queries are not yet supported — see
[future.md](./future.md).

## Cell views

Each predefined query can carry a **`cell_view`** map controlling how result
cells render. Author it as YAML in the **"Cell view"** modal (toolbar button just
before the **Min** toggle), stored as raw text on the query. The modal's **Save**
persists and closes; **Cancel** or the backdrop discards. Map keys are column
names; each entry has a `type` and a `value` template. Two placeholders are
substituted from the row being rendered:

- **`{cell}`** — this column's own raw value.
- **`{row.<column>}`** — the value of another column in the **same row** (e.g.
  `{row.name}` yields that row's `name` value). An unknown column name is left
  in place untouched.

```yaml
cve_id:
  type: link
  value: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/{cell}
severity:
  type: custom
  value: <strong>{cell}</strong>
name:
  type: link
  value: https://example.com/items/{row.id}
```

Supported types:

- **`link`** — render the cell as `<a href target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{cell}</a>`. `{cell}` and any `{row.<column>}` are URL-encoded into the href; the resolved scheme must be `http`/`https` (anything else falls back to plain text).
- **`custom`** — render the `value` HTML verbatim with `{cell}` and any `{row.<column>}` substituted in. Substituted values are HTML-escaped (so DB content can't break out), but the template HTML is **trusted** and is not sanitized. **Anyone who can save a predefined query can inject markup/script that runs in every viewer's browser**, because predefined queries are shared globally with no auth.

Substitution is a single pass, so a cell value that itself looks like a
placeholder is rendered as literal (escaped) text rather than re-resolved
against the row.

Both wrappers (the `<a>` for `link`, the `<span>` for `custom`) carry
`data-testid="cell-<columnName>"`, so e2e tests can target rendered cells without
baking testids into the YAML.

Rendering uses the **saved** `cell_view` of the **currently selected** predefined
query — editor edits take effect only after **Save** (which re-fetches the list).
Ad-hoc SQL with no selected query renders plain, as does a broken (unparseable or
unrecognized-shape) `cell_view`.

## Default views for complex types

Columns whose ClickHouse type is **`Array`**, **`Map`**, or **`Tuple`** get a
built-in **default view** with no `cell_view` authored: instead of the raw
serialized string (`['a','b']`, `{'x':1}`, `(1,'a')`) the cell renders a **plain
vertical list**. When a collection has more than 3 items the cell starts
**collapsed**, showing the first 3 with a `… (+N more)` expander; expanding
reveals the rest plus a `▾ collapse` control.

- **Array** — one element per line.
- **Map** — one `key → value` per line.
- **Tuple** — one `name: value` per line, using the **named-tuple** element names
  from the type (`Tuple(id Int32, name String)` → `id: 1`); unnamed tuples use
  the positional index (`0:`, `1:`).
- **`Array(Tuple(...))`** / **`Array(Map(...))`** — a list of elements where each
  element is rendered with its inner tuple / map view. The outer array still
  collapses to the first 3 elements.
- Nesting beyond those two cases (e.g. `Array(Array(...))`, a complex `Tuple`
  field) renders that nested piece as its **raw serialized substring**.

Types come from a `DESCRIBE (<query>)` run **automatically alongside each
Execute** (cached per query, so paging doesn't re-describe), independent of the
**Fields** picker. If that describe fails or the type isn't one of the above, the
cell renders as plain text. An explicit `cell_view` entry for a column **takes
precedence** over its default view (and is the way to opt out). Default views
apply to the on-screen table only — **Download CSV** keeps the raw serialized
value.

## Query parameters

A predefined query can declare **dropdown selectors** whose chosen value is
substituted into the SQL. They live in a reserved **`params:`** key inside the
`cell_view` YAML (so `params` is never treated as a column-render rule). Each entry
has a `name` and a list of `options`:

```yaml
params:
  - name: source
    options: [a, b, c]
```

With the query:

```sql
select * from events where source = {source}
```

a labelled dropdown appears above the SQL textarea, one per param, populated with
the declared options. The placeholder **`{source}`** is replaced with the selected
value as a **quoted SQL string** (`source = 'b'`), with embedded single quotes
doubled — write the placeholder where a value goes, no quotes of your own. A
`{name}` with no matching param is left untouched; a param whose `{name}` never
appears in the query is harmless.

**Changing a dropdown re-runs the query immediately** (resetting to offset 0).
Substitution applies everywhere the query runs — **Execute**, **Previous** /
**Next**, **Fields** (`DESCRIBE`), and **Download CSV**. The first option is the
default.

## Options from a query (`options_sql`)

Instead of a static `options` list, a param can derive its choices from a query:

```yaml
params:
  - name: host
    options_sql: SELECT DISTINCT host FROM system.clusters ORDER BY host
```

The **first column of every row** becomes an option, in the query's own order
(use `DISTINCT` / `ORDER BY` yourself — results are not de-duplicated or sorted).
The query runs once against the current connection when the predefined query
loads, and results are cached for the session. The first row is the default.

`options` and `options_sql` are **mutually exclusive** — declaring both drops the
param. If the `options_sql` query **fails or returns no rows**, the param has
nothing to choose from, so the main query is **blocked** (run controls disabled)
and the error banner names the param.

Because values are constrained to the declared options (or the `options_sql` rows)
and quoted/escaped on substitution, params stay within the existing trust model
(the SQL textarea is already sent to the backend as-is). A broken or absent
`params:` block renders no dropdowns.

## Results & CSV

Results come back from ClickHouse as `TabSeparatedWithNames` and render as an HTML
table (first row = column names), scrolling within the panel (wide results scroll
horizontally). **Download CSV** re-runs the current page as `CSVWithNames` and saves
`query.csv` — current page only, always every column regardless of the **Select
fields** view.

## API

| Method | Path                        | Body                                          | Result |
| ------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| POST   | `/api/clickhouse/query`     | `{query, limit?, offset?, format?, order_by?}` | `{ok, output}` (raw text) \| `{ok:false, message}`. `format:"csv"` returns CSV. `order_by` is `[{name, dir}]` (`dir` ASC/DESC). Empty query → `400`; no session → `409`. |
| POST   | `/api/clickhouse/describe`  | `{query}`                                     | `{ok, fields:[{name, type}]}` — the query's output columns, via `DESCRIBE`, no data scanned. \| `{ok:false, message}`. Empty query → `400`; no session / no database → `409`. |
| GET    | `/api/predefined-queries`   | `?type=<connType>`                            | `{queries:[{query_name, query, cell_view}]}` for that connection type. `cell_view` is raw YAML text or `null`. |
| POST   | `/api/predefined-queries`   | `{query_name, type, query, cell_view?}`       | `{ok}`; upserts a predefined query. `cell_view` is optional raw YAML; empty/missing clears it. Missing required fields → `400`. |

Queries run over the ClickHouse HTTP interface (HTTP Basic auth, 5s timeout),
scoped to the session's selected database.
